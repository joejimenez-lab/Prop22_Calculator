# Prop 22 Guarantee Calculator 🧮

This is a web-based calculator that helps gig workers (e.g., Uber Eats, DoorDash, etc.) in California determine if their pay meets the minimum guaranteed earnings under **Proposition 22**.

## 🚗 What it Does

Prop 22 guarantees:
- **120% of the local minimum wage** for active time (standardized to $19.80/hr here)
- **$0.36 per mile** for mileage

This tool lets users enter:
- Base pay from app
- Customer tip
- Active time (hours, minutes, seconds)
- Miles driven

The calculator will then display:
- Minimum guaranteed earnings
- Adjustment due (if base pay is below guarantee)
- Total earnings with and without tip
